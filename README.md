# Scrapy Adventure
A Scrapy Framework project on scraping a site with pagination, extracting item information, and outputing it to a csv file or inserting it to a database.

## Description
The site I'm going to scrape is one with all the information about Dungeons and Dragons Adventures. I want to extract all the information I need for every adventure like the title, the url link, the publisher, the level of the adventure, and the publication date.
The url of the site as of now is [this](https://merricb.com/dungeons-dragons-5e-adventures-by-level/).
